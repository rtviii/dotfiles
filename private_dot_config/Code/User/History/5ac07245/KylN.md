For the amount of columns in that csv, the interesting stuff seems somewhat slim.

We got ~3k replies and retweets, mostly from UK,USA,Germany,Spain,Belgium, Netherlands.

According to the twitter's sentiment classification we get out of the box, most (87%) of tweets(will refer to replys and retweets as tweets) are neutral with 10%/3% going to negative positive. This kinda checks out given that the large chunk of tweets are just retweets of one the few tweets that Isabela did(i'll list some examples below):

There are some shorthands for relevance like twitter followers, "reach" and "impressions" for each account. These have super long tails (few actual news outlets/experts with following and the majority are Joe Schmoes with less than 200 followers).
