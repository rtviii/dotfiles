For the amount of columns in that csv, the interesting stuff seems somewhat slim.

We got ~3k replies and retweets, mostly from UK,USA,Germany,Spain,Belgium, Netherlands.

According to the twitter's sentiment classification we get out of the box, most (87%) of tweets(will refer to replys and retweets as tweets) are neutral with 10%/3% going to negative positive. This kinda checks out given that the large chunk of tweets are just retweets of one the few tweets that Isabela did(i'll list some examples below)

```RT @IsabellaMWeber First Martin Wolf calling for price controls @ft, now this by Paul Krugman @nyt. Who's next?
